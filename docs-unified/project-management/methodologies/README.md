# Agile Methods (LightSpeed) – Internal Onboarding

This folder contains LightSpeed’s **Scrumban-focused** Agile documentation and helper tools
to plan and deliver WordPress projects (themes, block plugins) using **GitHub Projects** and **Asana**.

## Structure

- `agile/` – Agile overview, manifesto, and Scrum basics (1 file per URL).
- `scrum/` – Scrum events, artefacts, and practices (1 file per URL).
- `kanban/` – Kanban fundamentals and advanced topics (1 file per URL).
- `project-management/` – Agile PM topics (epics/stories/themes, Scrumban, Lean, CI).
- `field-guides/` – LightSpeed-specific field guides and meeting-driven practices.
- `copilot/` – Custom **Copilot Chat** chatmodes and prompts for planning and automation.

## Conventions

- **Parent issues = Epics**, **Child issues = Stories** (GitHub issues)
- **Milestones** = 2‑week timeboxes (Beta/RC/Final) acting as sprints
- **Releases** = tagged outputs with changelogs
- **Asana** used for non-code work and research; link Asana task ↔ GitHub issue as needed

> **Internal use only** – these docs are for LightSpeed onboarding, not public contributors.
