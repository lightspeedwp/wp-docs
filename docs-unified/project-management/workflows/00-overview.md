# Overview
This kit packages the process shared in the BugHerd × LightSpeed webinar:
- Content-first starts prevent late‑stage rework.
- Figma files include a Table of Contents for client & dev navigation.
- Staging feedback is captured with BugHerd for context and traceability.
- Each phase requires explicit sign-off.
