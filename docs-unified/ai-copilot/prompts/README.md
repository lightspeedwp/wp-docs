# Copilot — How We Use It for Patterns

Use Copilot Chat to scaffold, refactor, and review block patterns quickly.

- Paste `custom-instructions.md` into Copilot Chat "Custom Instructions" (or your team KB).
- Use `prompt-library.md` for task-specific prompts (scaffold, convert, review).
- Keep `agents.md` handy to switch mental modes (Architect, Woo Coach, A11y Reviewer).
- `chatmodes.md` groups workflows (Scaffold / Refactor / Review / Docs Mode).

> These docs are human guidelines; Copilot doesn’t auto-read them unless you add them to your knowledge base or paste snippets into Chat.
