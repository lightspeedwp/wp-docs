# Prompt: Refactor to a Synchronous Block

Given a dynamic pattern or mixed markup, refactor into a **static/sync block pattern** leveraging block supports and tokens.

Checklist:
- Remove bespoke wrappers; use core group/stack/row.
- Replace inline styles with `theme.json` tokens.
- Ensure headings levels are correct and unique on page.
- Provide a variation with media on alternate side.
