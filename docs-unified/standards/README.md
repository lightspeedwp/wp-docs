# Standards & Quality Guidelines

Comprehensive quality standards and guidelines for WordPress development, covering documentation practices, code review processes, and quality assurance frameworks to ensure consistent, high-quality deliverables.

## üìã Overview

Quality standards are the foundation of successful WordPress projects. This section provides enforceable guidelines, checklists, and processes that ensure consistency, maintainability, and excellence across all development work.

## üìÅ Section Structure

### Documentation Standards
**Path:** [`documentation/`](./documentation/)
- **Frontmatter Conventions**: YAML metadata standards
- **Markdown Guidelines**: Consistent formatting and structure
- **Language & Style**: UK English conventions and tone
- **Schema Definitions**: Data structure documentation standards
- **Cross-Reference Patterns**: Internal linking conventions

### Quality Gates
**Path:** [`quality-gates/`](./quality-gates/)
- **Code Review Checklists**: Comprehensive review criteria
- **Accessibility Requirements**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance checks
- **Performance Standards**: Core Web Vitals and optimization
- **Security Guidelines**: OWASP compliance and WordPress security
- **Release Criteria**: Definition of done for features and releases

### Language & Style
**Path:** [`language-style.md`](./language-style.md)
- UK English spelling and grammar conventions
- Inclusive language guidelines
- Technical writing best practices
- Terminology consistency standards

## üéØ Key Standards Areas

### Code Quality
- **WordPress Coding Standards**: PHPCS, WPCS compliance
- **JavaScript Standards**: ESLint, modern JS practices
- **CSS Standards**: Consistent methodology and organization
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance requirements
- **Performance**: Core Web Vitals optimization standards

### Documentation Quality
- **Consistency**: Uniform formatting and structure
- **Completeness**: Required sections and information
- **Accuracy**: Up-to-date and technically correct
- **Accessibility**: Screen reader friendly documentation
- **Searchability**: Structured for discoverability

### Process Quality
- **Review Process**: Multi-stage review requirements
- **Testing Standards**: Unit, integration, and E2E testing
- **Deployment Gates**: Pre-production quality checks
- **Monitoring**: Post-deployment quality verification
- **Continuous Improvement**: Regular standards updates

## ‚úÖ Quality Assurance Framework

### Four-Tier Quality Model

1. **Foundation Standards** (Must Have)
   - WordPress Coding Standards compliance
   - Security vulnerability scanning
   - Basic accessibility requirements
   - Performance baseline metrics

2. **Production Standards** (Should Have)
   - Comprehensive test coverage
   - Advanced accessibility features
   - Performance optimization
   - Documentation completeness

3. **Excellence Standards** (Could Have)
   - Advanced performance optimizations
   - Enhanced accessibility features
   - Comprehensive monitoring
   - Advanced security measures

4. **Innovation Standards** (Won't Have This Release)
   - Experimental features
   - Cutting-edge optimizations
   - Advanced automation
   - Future-focused enhancements

### Quality Gates by Phase

**Development Phase:**
- [ ] Code follows WordPress Coding Standards
- [ ] Unit tests pass with adequate coverage
- [ ] Security scan shows no high/critical issues
- [ ] Accessibility audit shows no violations
- [ ] Performance meets baseline requirements

**Review Phase:**
- [ ] Peer code review completed
- [ ] Technical documentation updated
- [ ] Integration tests pass
- [ ] Cross-browser testing completed
- [ ] Device compatibility verified

**Pre-Production Phase:**
- [ ] Full regression testing completed
- [ ] Performance optimization verified
- [ ] Security hardening implemented
- [ ] Backup and rollback procedures tested
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting configured

## üõ†Ô∏è Quality Tools

### Automated Quality Checks
- **PHPCS/WPCS**: WordPress coding standards
- **ESLint**: JavaScript quality and consistency
- **Stylelint**: CSS quality and organization
- **Lighthouse**: Performance and accessibility auditing
- **Security Scanner**: Vulnerability detection

### Manual Quality Processes
- **Code Review**: Peer review checklist
- **Accessibility Testing**: Manual accessibility verification
- **Performance Testing**: Real-world performance validation
- **Security Review**: Manual security assessment
- **User Acceptance**: End-user validation

## üÜï What's New

- **2025-09-24**: Consolidated quality standards documentation
- Enhanced accessibility requirements (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Updated performance standards for Core Web Vitals
- Integrated AI quality considerations
- Added continuous improvement framework

## üîÑ Standards Evolution

### Review Cycle
- **Quarterly**: Standards effectiveness review
- **Semi-Annual**: Major standards updates
- **Annual**: Complete standards audit
- **As-Needed**: Emergency standards updates

### Update Process
1. **Proposal**: Standards change proposal submitted
2. **Review**: Technical and stakeholder review
3. **Testing**: Pilot implementation and validation
4. **Approval**: Standards committee approval
5. **Implementation**: Rollout and training
6. **Monitoring**: Effectiveness measurement
