# DevOps & Infrastructure

Modern DevOps practices tailored for WordPress development, covering continuous integration, deployment strategies, infrastructure as code, monitoring, and site reliability engineering.

## üìã Overview

DevOps for WordPress requires understanding both general DevOps principles and WordPress-specific deployment considerations. This section provides practical guidance for building reliable, scalable WordPress infrastructure and deployment pipelines.

## üìÅ Section Structure

### CI/CD Pipeline
**Path:** [`ci-cd/`](./ci-cd/)
- GitHub Actions workflows
- Automated testing strategies
- Code quality gates
- WordPress-specific CI/CD patterns
- Multi-environment deployment

### Deployment Strategies
**Path:** [`deployment/`](./deployment/)
- Zero-downtime deployment
- Blue-green deployment for WordPress
- Database migration strategies
- Asset optimization and CDN
- Rollback procedures

### WordPress-Specific DevOps
**Path:** [`wordpress/`](./wordpress/)
- WordPress.org SVN deployment
- Plugin and theme deployment
- WordPress multisite considerations
- Core update strategies
- Security deployment practices

### Infrastructure Management
**Path:** [`infrastructure/`](./infrastructure/)
- Container orchestration (Docker, Kubernetes)
- Server provisioning and configuration
- Database management and scaling
- Caching strategies (Redis, Memcached)
- Load balancing and high availability

### Monitoring & Observability
**Path:** [`monitoring/`](./monitoring/)
- Application performance monitoring
- Error tracking and alerting
- Log aggregation and analysis
- WordPress-specific metrics
- Site health monitoring

## üéØ Quick Start Paths

**Setting up CI/CD?**
1. [`ci-cd/github-actions-wordpress.md`](./ci-cd/github-actions-wordpress.md)
2. [`ci-cd/testing-strategies.md`](./ci-cd/testing-strategies.md)
3. [`deployment/wordpress-deployment.md`](./deployment/wordpress-deployment.md)

**Deploying to WordPress.org?**
1. [`wordpress/svn-deployment.md`](./wordpress/svn-deployment.md)  
2. [`wordpress/plugin-release-process.md`](./wordpress/plugin-release-process.md)
3. [`ci-cd/automated-releases.md`](./ci-cd/automated-releases.md)

**Building Infrastructure?**
1. [`infrastructure/docker-wordpress.md`](./infrastructure/docker-wordpress.md)
2. [`infrastructure/server-setup.md`](./infrastructure/server-setup.md)
3. [`monitoring/performance-monitoring.md`](./monitoring/performance-monitoring.md)

## üîß Technology Stack

### Recommended Tools

**CI/CD Platforms:**
- GitHub Actions (primary)
- GitLab CI/CD
- Bitbucket Pipelines
- Jenkins (enterprise)

**Containerization:**
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Kubernetes (scalable deployments)
- Podman (alternative to Docker)

**Infrastructure as Code:**
- Terraform
- AWS CloudFormation
- Ansible (configuration management)
- Helm (Kubernetes packages)

**Monitoring & Logging:**
- New Relic / Datadog (APM)
- Prometheus + Grafana
- ELK Stack (logging)
- WordPress-specific: Query Monitor, Debug Bar

## üîó Cross-References

- **WordPress Development**: See [`../wordpress/`](../wordpress/) for development workflows
- **Project Management**: Check [`../project-management/`](../project-management/) for release planning
- **Standards**: Review [`../standards/devops.md`](../standards/devops.md) for quality gates
- **Templates**: Find CI/CD templates in [`../templates/devops/`](../templates/devops/)
- **AI Assistance**: Use [`../ai-copilot/devops/`](../ai-copilot/devops/) for automation prompts

## üè∑Ô∏è Content Tags

Content in this section uses these tags:
- `devops` - General DevOps practices
- `ci-cd` - Continuous integration/deployment
- `deployment` - Application deployment
- `infrastructure` - Server and infrastructure
- `monitoring` - Observability and monitoring
- `wordpress` - WordPress-specific practices
- `docker` - Containerization
- `security` - Security in DevOps
- `automation` - Process automation
- `performance` - Performance optimization

## ‚úÖ DevOps Principles

All DevOps guidance follows these principles:

1. **Automation First**: Automate repetitive tasks and processes
2. **Infrastructure as Code**: Version-controlled infrastructure
3. **Continuous Integration**: Regular code integration and testing
4. **Monitoring Everything**: Comprehensive observability
5. **Security by Design**: Security integrated throughout pipeline
6. **Fail Fast**: Quick feedback loops and rapid iteration
7. **Disaster Recovery**: Backup and recovery procedures

## üö® WordPress-Specific Considerations

### Database Migrations
- WordPress database structure considerations
- Plugin activation/deactivation in deployments
- Multisite deployment complexities
- Content staging and synchronization

### Performance
- WordPress caching layers (object, page, CDN)
- Database query optimization
- Asset optimization pipelines
- Core Web Vitals monitoring

### Security
- WordPress security hardening
- Plugin/theme vulnerability scanning
- Automated security updates
- Access control and permissions

## üÜï What's New

- **2025-09-24**: Consolidated DevOps documentation
- Enhanced WordPress-specific deployment guides
- Updated CI/CD templates for GitHub Actions
- Added container orchestration patterns
- Integrated monitoring and observability practices

## üîÑ Contributing

When adding DevOps content:

1. **Test Procedures**: Verify all deployment steps work
2. **Include Rollback**: Document rollback procedures
3. **Security Review**: Consider security implications
4. **Performance Impact**: Measure deployment performance
5. **Cross-Platform**: Consider different hosting environments
6. **Update Automation**: Integrate with existing CI/CD
