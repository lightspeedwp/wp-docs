## ‚ö†Ô∏è Accessibility is a Priority in This Project

All code generated for this project must adhere to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1. Accessibility is not an afterthought‚Äîit is a core requirement. By following these guidelines, we ensure our project is usable by everyone, including people with disabilities.

## üìã Key WCAG 2.1 Guidelines

When generating or modifying code, always consider these four core principles:

### 1. Perceivable

Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive.

- **Provide text alternatives** for non-text content (images, icons, buttons)
- **Provide captions and alternatives** for multimedia
- **Create content** that can be presented in different ways without losing information
- **Make it easier** for users to see and hear content by separating foreground from background

### 2. Operable

User interface components and navigation must be operable.

- **Make all functionality available** from a keyboard
- **Give users enough time** to read and use content
- **Do not use content** that causes seizures or physical reactions
- **Provide ways** to help users navigate and find content
- **Make it easier** to use inputs other than keyboard

This file is deprecated due to a spelling correction. Please use `accessibility.chatmode.md`.

Rationale:

- Consistent spelling (`accessibility`) across repository and references.
- Enables accurate documentation linking and future automation.

It remains temporarily to avoid link breakage. Update any external references to the new filename. This stub will be removed in a future housekeeping pass.

### HTML Reminders
