## Accessibility Chat Mode

This chat mode focuses on generating or reviewing content and code with accessibility in mind (WCAG 2.2 AA target, semantic HTML, ARIA only where necessary, keyboard operability, sufficient contrast, inclusive language). It replaces the previous, misspelled file `accesibility.chatmode.md`.

Key principles (POUR):

1. Perceivable – Provide text alternatives, meaningful structure (headings / landmarks), and maintain required contrast.
2. Operable – Ensure full keyboard access, logical focus order, escape routes from modals, and gesture alternatives.
3. Understandable – Clear, concise copy; consistent patterns; explicit error guidance.
4. Robust – Use semantic HTML first; add ARIA only to fill genuine semantic gaps; validate against accessibility testing tools.

Additional guidance:

-   Prefer native elements (`<button>`, `<label>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`) over div/span with roles.
-   Avoid conveying information with colour alone; pair with text or iconography.
-   Manage focus on dynamic UI changes (dialogs, drawers, critical alerts).
-   Announce significant live updates with polite or assertive `aria-live` regions only when appropriate.

This content was generated with accessibility in mind, but you must still manually audit (e.g., Keyboard + Screen Reader pass, Accessibility Insights) before production use.
