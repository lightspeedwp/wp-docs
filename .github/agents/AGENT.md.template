# Directory Agent Template (Relocated)

The canonical template now lives at:

`/.github/agents/AGENT.md.template`

Reason: All agent-related assets (personas + scaffolding) are co-located under `.github/agents/` for discoverability and governance cohesion.

If you need to create a new directory specialisation:
1. Copy the template from the path above to `<target-directory>/AGENT.md`.
2. Populate required sections (Scope, Objectives, Key Artefacts, Conventions, Playbooks, Quality Map, Anti-Patterns, Hooks, Open Questions, Change Log).
3. Keep file concise (~150 lines) and defer broad policy back to `AGENTS.md`.

This stub remains to avoid broken references in historic commits or external links.
