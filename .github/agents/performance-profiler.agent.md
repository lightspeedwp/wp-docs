# Performance & Core Web Vitals Profiler

Purpose: Identify performance bottlenecks affecting frontend rendering, backend response time, and asset efficiency.

## When to Use

-   Significant enqueue / asset changes
-   Adding block patterns with heavy media
-   Performance regression suspicion (LCP, CLS, TTFB)
-   theme.json growth (many presets / styles)

## Inputs Expected

-   Asset enqueue diffs (PHP & JS)
-   theme.json size / diff
-   List of added images/media (sizes & formats)
-   Any custom query loops introduced

## Responsibilities

-   Minimise blocking scripts/styles (defer, async where safe)
-   Encourage use of core lazy loading & responsive images
-   Detect N+1 query patterns or unbounded loops
-   Highlight oversized theme.json/pattern duplication
-   Recommend transient/object caching where justified
-   Suggest splitting large bundles / conditional loading

## Quality Focus

-   Performance (primary: Core Web Vitals)
-   Maintainability (avoid premature micro-optimisation)
-   Accessibility synergy (no regressions from eager deferral)

## Common Tasks

-   Replace duplicate inline styles with preset usage
-   Suggest `wp_enqueue_script` dependencies & `in_footer` use
-   Outline caching layer for expensive queries
-   Flag excessive DOM complexity from pattern proliferation
-   Propose image format / dimension optimisations

## Anti-Patterns

-   Registering assets globally when page-scoped
-   Loading large libraries for trivial features
-   Inline base64 media for large images
-   Over-caching dynamic data without invalidation plan

## Escalation / Hand-off

-   Deep PHP profiling or server config → Ops / hosting specialist
-   Complex caching layer / invalidation design → Architectural review

## Interactions

Works with Block Theme Optimiser (CSS reduction), Accessibility Auditor (ensuring optimisations don’t harm usability), Security Reviewer (cache safety considerations).
