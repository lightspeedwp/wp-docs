# lightspeedwp Rebranding Change Log (Phase 1: Contextualization)

Date: (initial generation)

## Overview

This change log documents the additive, non-destructive rebranding work performed to align the repository with the evolving **lightspeedwp** mission: accelerating high-quality WordPress engineering (block themes, plugins, performance, accessibility, security, i18n) while retaining broadly applicable software engineering assets (architecture, testing, ops, cloud, data, IaC) required by modern WP-integrated stacks.

## [Unreleased]

### Planned

-   Domain & stability surfacing in generated README tables.
-   Frontmatter & internal link validator (CI).
-   Collections curation after taxonomy.

## [0.1.1] - 2025-09-25

### Added

-   WordPress inline documentation Copilot assets following official WordPress coding standards:
    -   `wordpress-inline-documentation.instructions.md` - Global documentation guidelines
    -   `wordpress-inline-documentation-generator.prompts.md` - Standards-compliant documentation generation
    -   `wordpress-documentation-expert.chatmodes.md` - Interactive documentation assistance  
    -   `wordpress-documentation-specialist.agents.md` - Specialized documentation domain expert
-   WordPress coding standards integration in `custom-instructions.md` with links to official WordPress documentation guidelines
-   Enhanced VS Code configuration with proper file associations for plural extensions (`.chatmodes.md`, `.prompts.md`, `.agents.md`)

### Changed

-   Cleaned up repository configuration files irrelevant to documentation repository
-   Updated VS Code workspace settings for better file associations and extension recommendations
-   Removed unnecessary build tool configurations (webpack, browserslist, stylelint)
-   Streamlined package.json dependencies focusing on documentation and linting needs
-   Updated README.md to reflect actual repository structure (.github/ instead of docs/copilot-space/)
-   Enhanced DEVELOPMENT.md with comprehensive script documentation and workflow guidance

### Removed

-   `webpack.config.js` - Not needed for documentation repository
-   `.browserslistrc` - Only needed for frontend asset compilation  
-   `stylelint.config.js` and `.stylelintrc.json` - No CSS files to lint
-   `github.code-workspace` - Redundant with `wp-docs.code-workspace`
-   Duplicate configuration files (`.prettierignore copy`, `.stylelintrc copy.json`)
-   CSS/SCSS related VS Code extensions since no CSS files exist in repository

### Fixed

-   Section numbering in `custom-instructions.md` (removed duplicate section 6)
-   VS Code file associations now properly recognize plural file extensions
-   Updated extension recommendations to focus on WordPress documentation and AI development tools
-   Repository structure references throughout documentation files

## [0.1.0] - 2025-09-20

### Added

-   Global agent governance (`AGENTS.md`) and specialised agent personas scaffold.
-   Documentation hub under `docs/` with `docs/README.md` central index.
-   Block theme guidance set, coding standards overlays, Gutenberg guides, frontmatter schemas.
-   UK English language style guide (`docs/language-style.md`) and normalisation scripts (`lang:en-gb` npm scripts).
-   Automation scripts relocated to `.github/scripts/` (generator, validator, YAML parser, collection creator).
-   Accessibility, performance, security, i18n instruction assets and governance.

### Changed

-   Rebranded root README to reflect WordPress engineering + AI assets mission.
-   Consolidated changelog into canonical `CHANGELOG.md` (previous rebrand file merged).
-   Updated documentation to reference unified GPLv3 license.
-   Normalised misspelled accessibility chat mode filename and added deprecation stub.

### Removed

-   Transitional `.real` indirection files for scripts.

### Deprecated

-   Legacy duplicated `README.instructions.md` (now bannered / pointing to canonical instructions location).

### Security

-   Reinforced guidance on escaping, sanitisation, nonce & capability checks in agent governance.

### Documentation

-   Added rationale for preserving crossâ€‘technology assets pending tagging (WordPress-first overlay strategy).
-   Added script usage guidance for regeneration & language normalisation.
