# lightspeedwp Rebranding Change Log (Phase 1: Contextualization)

Date: (initial generation)

## Overview

This change log documents the additive, non-destructive rebranding work performed to align the repository with the evolving **lightspeedwp** mission: accelerating high-quality WordPress engineering (block themes, plugins, performance, accessibility, security, i18n) while retaining broadly applicable software engineering assets (architecture, testing, ops, cloud, data, IaC) required by modern WP-integrated stacks.
