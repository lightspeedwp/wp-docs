# Style Variations

---

## Best practices
- **Style variations**: Visual alternatives for a block via `theme.json`.
- **Block variations**: Structural variations shown at insert time, registered via JS (`wp.blocks.registerBlockVariation`). ([Rich Tabor](https://rich.blog/block-variations/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

---

## Use when
- Use style variations for styling; block variations for altering block structure/configuration.

---

## Limitations
- Do not confuse them; they are distinct APIs with different use cases.
