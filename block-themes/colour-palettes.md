# Colour Palettes
Covers how to define and standardize colour palettes in theme.json for consistent theme switching, including best practices and pitfalls.

---

## Best practices
- Standardize slugs: `base`, `contrast`, `primary` to ensure consistent theme switching and user flow. 
- Define in `settings.color.palette` to auto-generate CSS variables and `.has-*` classes.
- Treat slug changes as breaking. Blocks and patterns use generated classes (e.g. `.has-primary-color`, `.has-contrast-background-color`) and variables (e.g. `var(--wp--preset--color--primary)`). Renaming slugs to literal colour names like `green` will break styling when switching themes.

## Limitations
- Breaking slug names (like `green`) may result in broken styling when switching themes.
